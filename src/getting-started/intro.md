# Getting Started

Welcome to the Simple Documentation Generator! This tool helps you create beautiful documentation websites from Markdown files.

## What is This?

This is a simplified MVP (Minimum Viable Product) based on the [OutSystems/docs-odc](https://github.com/OutSystems/docs-odc) project. It provides core documentation generation functionality:

- Convert Markdown files to HTML
- Organize content with YAML table of contents
- Preview locally with a built-in web server
- Deploy anywhere as static files

## Quick Overview

The workflow is simple:

1. **Write** your documentation in Markdown
2. **Organize** it with the `toc.yml` file
3. **Build** with `python build.py`
4. **Preview** with `python serve.py`
5. **Deploy** the `build/` folder

## Next Steps

- [Installation](installation.md) - Set up the tool
- [Quick Start](quickstart.md) - Create your first documentation
- [Writing Docs](writing-docs.md) - Learn Markdown syntax
